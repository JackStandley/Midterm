Jack Standley has played numerous sports over the years such as swimming, golf, soccer and most promintently baseball. Jack has always been an athelete at heart, he began playing sports at age four when he played baseball for the Panthers.  

## Freshman Year

Jack played baseball from when he was 4 up until his senior year of highschool.  
Baseball was his all time favorite sport. He won many tournaments in his younger years but nothing topped his four years of highschool baseball.  

At the start of his freshman season Jack was projected to be a PO. A PO is a "pitcher only" which means I don't get to bat. Jack became the teams ace pitcher after his first 3 incredible starts. Slowly, Jack began to see the line up more and more often. He slowly developed into the teams lead off hitter because of his burning speed on the base paths. Jack ended up leading his team to a second place finish in the GAC champtionship.
This season came to fruition at our end of the year banquet. Jack was awarded MVP and cemented his legacy into the Fort Zumwalt West history books.

## Other Sports

Baseball was ultimately Jacks passion, but there were a couple other sports that caught his attention over the years.  

Other than baseball Jack dabbled in soccer, swimming, and sand volleyball. Jack was very good at these sports. For example, Jack hated going to swimming practice, so he never went. But when the meets came around he would still dominate the competition.  

Sand volleyball was a more recent hobby as Jack and all his friends when to the sand volleyball courts religiously over quarentine. Jack was exponentially better than his friends and it showed on the court.
